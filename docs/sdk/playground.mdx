```python
playground(label: str, query: str, source: str = None, size: float = 1.0) -> pd.DataFrame
```

The `playground` function allows you to create an interactive SQL playground within your application. It provides a dynamic interface for querying connected data sources and visualizing results directly.

## Parameters

- **`label`** _(str)_: The display label for the playground component. This is used for identification and UI rendering.
- **`query`** _(str)_: The SQL query string to execute. This supports standard SQL syntax and can include `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, etc.
- **`source`** _(str, optional)_: _(Optional)_ The name of the specific data source to query. If not provided, the function attempts to **auto-detect** the data source from the SQL query itself. _(See "Default Behavior for `source`" below)_
- **`size`** _(float)_: _(Optional)_ The width of the component in a row. Defaults to `1.0` (full row).

For example:  
```python
playground(
    label="User Data",
    query="SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30"
)
```
In this case, `source` is auto-detected as `users`.

**Note:** Auto-detection works best when the query has a clear `FROM` or `JOIN` clause.

## Returns

- `pd.DataFrame`: The resulting DataFrame after executing the query. You can use it for further processing or visualization.

## Usage Example

Here's how to create a simple playground:

```python
from preswald import playground

# Create the playground with auto-detection of the data source
df = playground(
    label="User Age Filter", 
    query="SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age > 25"
)
```

Or, explicitly pass the data source:

```python
df = playground(
    label="User Age Filter",
    query="SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age > 25",
    source="users"
)
```

## Query Execution

The playground component:
1. Auto-loads any saved query state (if user modified the query previously).
2. Runs the SQL query against the provided or detected data source.
3. Renders the result interactively in the frontend.

## Error Handling

- Handles invalid queries and missing data sources gracefully
- Captures and displays query errors in the UI
- Logs detailed debug information for troubleshooting

## Best Practices

1. Use meaningful labels to distinguish multiple playgrounds.
2. Prefer explicit `source` when working with complex queries or joins.
3. Always review auto-detected source for correctness.
4. Use appropriate `WHERE` clauses to limit large datasets.
5. Handle exceptions gracefully to improve user experience.
