```python
workflow_dag(workflow: Workflow, title: str = "Workflow Dependency Graph") -> Dict
```

The `workflow_dag` function renders a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) visualization for a given workflow. This helps you visualize dependencies, execution status, and relationships within the workflow, making it easier to understand and debug complex processes.

## Parameters

- **`workflow`** _(Workflow)_: A workflow object representing the process or pipeline to be visualized.
- **`title`** _(str)_: _(Optional)_ The title displayed above the visualization. Defaults to `"Workflow Dependency Graph"`.

## Returns

- `Dict`: A component containing the DAG visualization data with node information.

## Node Information

Each node in the DAG contains the following information:

- **name**: The name of the task/node
- **status**: Current execution status
- **execution_time**: Time taken for execution
- **attempts**: Number of execution attempts
- **error**: Any error information if failed
- **dependencies**: List of dependent tasks
- **force_recompute**: Whether the task is marked for recomputation

## Usage Example

Here's an example of how to visualize a workflow using `workflow_dag`:

```python
from preswald import workflow_dag, Workflow

# Create a workflow object
workflow = Workflow()

# Add some tasks to the workflow
@workflow.task()
def task_a():
    return "A"

@workflow.task(depends_on=[task_a])
def task_b():
    return "B"

# Render the workflow DAG
workflow_dag(workflow, title="Example Workflow")
```

### Key Features

1. **Rich Node Data**: Each node shows detailed execution information
2. **Dependency Visualization**: Clear representation of task dependencies
3. **Status Tracking**: Visual indicators for task status (success/failure/pending)
4. **Performance Insights**: Shows execution time and attempt counts
5. **Error Visibility**: Displays error information for failed tasks

### Common Use Cases

Workflow DAGs are essential for:

- Debugging complex workflows
- Monitoring task execution
- Understanding dependency chains
- Identifying bottlenecks
- Tracking execution progress
- Visualizing pipeline structure

### Why Use `workflow_dag`?

The workflow DAG visualization helps you:

- Understand complex task relationships
- Monitor workflow execution status
- Debug failed tasks
- Optimize workflow structure
- Share workflow insights with team members

Perfect for both development and production monitoring of your workflow pipelines! 🔍
