```python
query(sql: str, source_name: str) -> pd.DataFrame
```

The `query` function executes SQL queries against configured data sources and returns the results as a pandas DataFrame. It supports all data source types (CSV, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse).

## Parameters

- `sql` (str): SQL query to execute
- `source_name` (str): Name of the data source as configured in preswald.toml

## Returns

- `pd.DataFrame`: Query results as a pandas DataFrame

## Usage Examples

### CSV Source

For CSV sources, you can query the data using standard SQL:

```python
from preswald import query

# Query CSV data
sql = """
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        COUNT(*) as order_count
    FROM eq_csv 
    GROUP BY customer_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
"""
frequent_customers = query(sql, 'eq_csv')
```

### PostgreSQL Source

For PostgreSQL sources, queries are executed directly against the database:

```python
from preswald import query

# Query PostgreSQL table
sql = """
    SELECT 
        date,
        magnitude,
        location
    FROM earthquake_events
    WHERE magnitude > 5.0
    ORDER BY magnitude DESC
    LIMIT 10
"""
major_earthquakes = query(sql, 'eq_pg')
```

### ClickHouse Source

ClickHouse queries are also supported:

```python
from preswald import query

# Query ClickHouse table
sql = """
    SELECT 
        toDate(timestamp) as date,
        count() as event_count
    FROM events
    GROUP BY date
    ORDER BY date DESC
    LIMIT 7
"""
daily_events = query(sql, 'eq_clickhouse')
```

## Query Engine

The query function uses DuckDB as the underlying query engine:

1. For CSV files, DuckDB reads and processes the data directly
2. For PostgreSQL, queries are executed through the postgres_scanner extension
3. For ClickHouse, queries use the clickhouse_scanner extension

## Error Handling

The function includes comprehensive error handling:

1. Validates source existence
2. Validates SQL syntax
3. Handles connection and query errors
4. Provides detailed error messages through logging

Example with error handling:

```python
from preswald import query

try:
    results = query("SELECT * FROM events", 'eq_clickhouse')
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Configuration error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Query error: {e}")
```

## Best Practices

1. Always call `connect()` before using
2. Always check if source exists in preswald.toml before querying
3. Use parameterized queries when possible to prevent SQL injection
4. Consider query performance and data volume
5. Include appropriate WHERE clauses to limit result sets
6. Use error handling when executing queries
