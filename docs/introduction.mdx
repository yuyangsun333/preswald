Preswald is a static-site generator for building interactive data apps in Python. It packages compute, data access, and UI into self-contained data apps that run locally in the browser. Built on a WASM runtime with Pyodide and DuckDB, Preswald enables portable, file-based apps that are fast, reactive, and shareable.

You can think of Preswald as a lightweight alternative to heavier web app platforms. It provides built-in UI components and reactive state tracking, so you can use it to build dashboards, reports, prototypes, workflows, and notebooks that are reactive, portable, and secure by default.

## **Key Features**

- Code-based development – Write apps in Python, not in notebooks or JS frameworks
- File-first approach – One command creates a fully-packaged `.html` app
- Built for computation – Use Pyodide + DuckDB directly in-browser
- Composable UI – Use prebuilt components like tables, charts, forms
- Reactive engine – Only re-run what's needed, powered by a DAG of dependencies
- Local execution – No server. Runs offline, even with large data
- AI-ready – Apps are fully inspectable and modifiable by agents
- High-performance GPU charts – Render real-time, interactive charts using fastplotlib, with offscreen GPU acceleration and WebSocket-based streaming to the browser
